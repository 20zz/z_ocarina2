I'm going to tell you how to modify "Japanese text" of ZELDA. But please 
note that a modification of "English text" is different from case of 
"Japanese text". I wish that it will help your localization.

(0) We assume using INDY.


(1) Please place following files into a same directory.
    "jp_msg.tar.gz" that I've uploaded to your SSH server
    contains following files.

 [Source files of Japanese text messages.
 Their file format is EGWORD ver.7 of Macintosh]
  ALL_0    NAVI_8  DOOR    BOARD   TEKI     Z_ZELDA  MORI_1
  HEIYA_2  YAMA_3  KAWA_4  MURA_5  SABAKU_6 SIRO_7   END_TXT

 [Executable file]
  message_change

 ["message_change" refers to this file]
  message.tbl


(2) Modify the source files if you want.


(3) Execute "message_change".  Three files ("zld64_msg_data.c",
    "zld64_msg_data.h", and "zld64_msg_data.tbl") will be generated.
 

(4) Compile "zld64_msg_data.c" like below lines:
    cc -c zld64_msg_data.c


(5) Copy (and rename) files into suitable directory.
    cp zld64_msg_data.o   $ZELDA_ROOT/data/message.o
    cp zld64_msg_data.h   $ZELDA_ROOT/data/msg.h
    cp zld64_msg_data.tbl $ZELDA_ROOT/data/msg.tbl


(6) Build rom image.
